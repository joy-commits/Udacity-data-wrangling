# Udacity-data-wrangling
Data wrangling is a very key part of the data analysis process, and it is said to take the most time among all the other phases/stages. 
Data wrangling entails gathering the data, assessing the data quality and structure, and cleaning it (before the other processes of analyzing the data, visualizing the data, and building predictive models using machine learning).

In this project, data wrangling was performed on the tweets from a Twitter handle "WeRateDogs". WeRateDogs is a Twitter handle that is a legit verified source for professional dog ratings. Active since November 2015 and with total tweets and retweets of over 15,700, it has a followership of about 9.2 million followers as at June 2022. 
The WeRateDogs account also classifies dogs into four (4) stages. These stages are the pupper, puppo, doggo and floofer stages. The puppers are puppies. The puppos are the "older puppers". The doggos are the "older puppos". The floofers are the "fluffy" or "hairy" dogs.

Three datasets (from three various sources) were used for the data wrangling project.
The first was downloaded. For the second, the "requests" library was used to download it. The third was additional dataset extracted from Twitter using the Twitter API.
